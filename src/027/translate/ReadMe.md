# Translate

This demo performs a translation from English to Pig Latin. It's set up as a Node project, and I used the `pnpm` package manager to set it up. You can use `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer.

```powershell
pnpm init
pnpm add vitest
```

The `vitest` package allows me to write some unit tests to build out the functionality of my program.
