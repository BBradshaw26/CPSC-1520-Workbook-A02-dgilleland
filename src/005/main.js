// - [ ] Distinguish between primitive data types and object data types in JavaScript
//    - You can recognize primitive data types from literal values such as numbers and text
var myNumber = 5;
var myString = "Hello";
//    - You can also discover the data type of a variable by using the `typeof` operator
console.log('myNumber is a:', typeof myNumber);
console.log('myString is a:', typeof myString);
//    - And if you change the value of a variable to a different type, then the type of the variable will change
myNumber = "Hello";
console.log('myNumber is a:', typeof myNumber);


// - [ ] List the primitive data types built-in to JavaScript
//     - `undefined` - represents a variable that has not been assigned a value
var myUndefined;
console.log('myUndefined is a:', typeof myUndefined);
//     - `null` - represents a variable that has been explicitly assigned the value `null`
var myNull = null;
console.log('myNull is a:', typeof myNull);
//     - `boolean` - represents a variable that has been assigned the value `true` or `false`
var myBoolean = true;
console.log('myBoolean is a:', typeof myBoolean);
//     - `number` - represents a variable that has been assigned a numeric value
var myNumber = 5; // Note how we can re-declare a variable with a different type
console.log('myNumber is a:', typeof myNumber);
//     - `string` - represents a variable that has been assigned a text value
var myString = "Hello";
console.log('myString is a:', typeof myString);
// - [ ] Distinguish between the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords
//     - `var` is used to declare a variable that is in the global scope or function scope
//     - `let` is used to declare a variable that is in the block scope
//     - `const` is used to declare a variable whose value cannot be changed

// - [ ] List the various assignment operators in JavaScript
// - [ ] Explain the difference between the `++` and `--` operators when used as a prefix vs postfix on a variable
// - [ ] Explain why the increment and decrement operators cannot be used on literal numbers
// - [ ] Distinguish between the special JavaScript values of `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and `Infinity`
