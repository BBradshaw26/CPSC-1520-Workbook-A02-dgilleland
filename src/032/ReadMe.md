# Serving JSON

> A brief foray into serving JSON in a node.js application using `json-server`.

## Description

There is a nice and simple node package that helps with setting up a fake REST API server for testing purposes. It is called [**`json-server`**](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and it is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). It is very easy to use and it can be installed globally or locally.
