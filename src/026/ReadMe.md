## Node + Parcel + Validator

- [ ] [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
- [ ] [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - A web application bundler
- [ ] [Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) - A library of string validators and sanitizers

> Node.js first came on the scene in 2009. Created by Ryan Dhal, it was a way to run JavaScript outside of the browser. It was originally created to run on Linux, but has since been ported to run on Windows and Mac OS X. Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser. Node.js is an open source project that is maintained by the [Node.js Foundation](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
> 
> Whenever we talk about Node, we will also talk about `npm`. `npm` is the Node Package Manager. It is a command line tool that is used to install, share, and distribute code. It is also used to manage dependencies in Node.js projects. GitHub purchased `npm` in 2020. NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, but other package manager tools such as `yarn` and `pnpm` have arisen over the years.

For this first example, we will create a simple Node.js project that uses the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler to bundle our JavaScript and CSS files. We will use a class-less CSS library called ["Bolt"](https://boltcss.com/). We will also use the [Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) library to validate user information, such as credit card numbers and web URLs.
